'''
Given a string s consisting of small English letters, find and return the first instance of a non-repeating character in it. If there is no such character, return '_'.
Example
For s = "abacabad", the output should be
firstNotRepeatingCharacter(s) = 'c'.
There are 2 non-repeating characters in the string: 'c' and 'd'. Return c since it appears in the string first.
For s = "abacabaabacaba", the output should be
firstNotRepeatingCharacter(s) = '_'.
