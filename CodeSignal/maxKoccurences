For sequence = "ababcbabc" and words = ["ab", "babc", "bca"], the output should be maxKOccurrences(sequence, words) = [2, 2, 0].

words[0] = "ab" is a 2-occurrence of sequence, because sequence[0..4] = "abab";
words[0] = "ab" is not a 3-occurence of sequence, because there is no substring "ababab" in sequence;
words[1] = "babc" is a 2-occurrence of sequence, because sequence[1..8] = "babcbabc";
words[1] = "babc" is not a 3-occurence of sequence, because there is no substring "babcbabcbabc" in sequence;
words[2] = "bca" is a 0-occurrence of sequence, because there is no substring "bca" in sequence.
